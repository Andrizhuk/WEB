    A round trip from Central Italy to Northern Germany isn’t exactly a short drive,
    but it becomes an even longer one when the journey is made in the type of car that
    turns every winding out-of-the-way road into an opportunity for a detour. Especially
    if your trip is taking place in the 1990s, and you’re sitting in the road-going 
    version of a World Rally Championship (WRC) winner—like a high-performance Lancia—and
    the derestricted sections of German Autobahn are in abundance. Not that you’d be 
    looking for straight lines to stretch the legs of this boxy but agile machine.
